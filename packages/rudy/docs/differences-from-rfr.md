# Differences from [redux-first-router](https://github.com/faceyspacey/redux-first-router)

* `[NOT_FOUND]` -> `"NOT_FOUND"` in reducers (e.g. page reducer).
* `connectRoutes` has been renamed to `createRouter` and does not return `enhancer` anymore.
* `firstRoute`, now returned from `createRouter`, must be invoked before rendering.
* `payload` has been renamed to `params`, e.g. `{ type: 'FOO', params: {} }` and `state.location.params`.
