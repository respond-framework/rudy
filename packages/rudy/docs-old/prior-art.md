# Prior Art

The following packages attempt in similar ways to reconcile the browser
`history` with redux actions and state:

- **redux-little-router**  
  https://github.com/FormidableLabs/redux-little-router  
  A tiny router for Redux that lets the URL do the talking.

* **universal-redux-router**  
  https://github.com/colinmeinke/universal-redux-router  
  A router that turns URL params into first-class Redux state and runs action
  creators on navigation

- **redux-history-sync**  
  https://github.com/cape-io/redux-history-sync  
  Essentially, this module syncs browser history locations with a Redux store.
  If you are looking to read and write changes to the address bar via Redux this
  might be for you.

- **Redux Unity Router**  
  https://github.com/TimeRaider/redux-unity-router  
  Simple routing for your redux application. The main purpose of this router is
  to mirror your browser history to the redux store and help you easily declare
  routes.
