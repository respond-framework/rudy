### Bug Fixes

* **history:** delete console.log from BrowserHistory ([#58](https://github.com/respond-framework/rudy/tree/master/packages/rudy/issues/58)) ([4d1a4e4](https://github.com/respond-framework/rudy/tree/master/packages/rudy/commit/4d1a4e4)), closes [#46](https://github.com/respond-framework/rudy/tree/master/packages/rudy/issues/46)

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **history:** browsers that don't support the history API or session storage are no longer supported at all. In practice this means IE9 is no longer supported.
* **history:** future entries in the history stack remain even if the user has since navigated from a previous entry to an external site (because they are no longer removed when they are potentially still the future entries in the browser stack)

Fixes https://github.com/respond-framework/rudy/issues/59





## [0.1.1-test.4](https://github.com/respond-framework/rudy/tree/master/packages/rudy/compare/@respond-framework/rudy@0.1.1-test.3...@respond-framework/rudy@0.1.1-test.4) (2019-09-10)

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **history:** dispatching a route that matches the previous/next route in the history stack is no longer reinterpreted as a back/next action
* **history:** history functions `set`/`setParams`/`setState`/`setQuery`/`setHash`/`setBasename` no longer accept a function as an argument
* **history:** history functions `set`/`setParams`/`setState`/`setQuery` no longer merge their arguments with the existing params/state/query
